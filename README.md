**1. Introduction**
LendingClub is a large US company that connects people who want to lend money with people who need to borrow it (peer-to-peer lending). This case study shows how we can use data to solve a real business problem: How do we stop the company from losing money on bad loans?

**2. How the Business Works**
 When a person applies for a loan, the company has to make a tough decision: Approve or Reject.

**There are two main risks:**

**If you Reject a good applicant:** The company loses a customer and misses out on profit.

**If you Approve a bad applicant:** The applicant might never pay the money back. This causes a financial loss.

**Understanding Loan Status:** When a loan is approved, three things can happen:

**Fully Paid:** The person paid back all the money. (This is good).

**Current:** The person is still making payments on time.

**Charged-off:** The person stopped paying. They have defaulted. (This is bad).
